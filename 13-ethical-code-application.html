            <h2>Ethical Code Application in Medical Implant Risk Analysis</h2>
            <p>
              Corazón, a startup specialising in implantable heart health monitoring devices, presents an exemplary case of the responsible integration of technology in healthcare, adhering closely to many principles of professional ethical conduct. However, potential vulnerabilities in their wireless connectivity reveal key challenges that demand an evaluation of the ethical implications, legal concerns, and impact on professionalism in the field of computing. To frame this discussion, Corazón's actions are evaluated in light of the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct and the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct.

            </p>
            <p>
              Corazón’s commitment to providing access to healthcare through affordable devices and partnerships with charities reflects its contribution to society and human well-being, as highlighted by the first ACM Code and the BCS Code's principle of serving the public interest (ACM, 2018; BCS, N.D.). Corazón's actions show responsibility towards public welfare, particularly for underprivileged individuals, which is fundamental to both the ACM and BCS codes. The World Health Organisation emphasises the importance of technology in improving global healthcare equity, particularly for low-income communities (WHO, 2024). Corazón’s socially driven mission can be seen as fulfilling this broader global health objective.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, illustrating its commitment to ethical risk management, Corazón handled a reported security vulnerability with diligence.  The researcher’s discovery of a hard-coded initialisation value presents a potential risk, even if deemed minimal for now. Corazón’s immediate investigation of the vulnerability highlights its responsibility in ensuring the safety and security of its users, following ACM’s Principle 2.5, which mandates a rigorous approach to risk analysis (ACM, 2018;). Furthermore, BCS’s Public Interest principle underlines the importance of recognising and mitigating risks that could harm the public, even when the risk appears negligible (BCS, N.D.). 


            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover,   Corazón’s product operates in various countries, making compliance with different regulatory frameworks a critical issue. Failure to address security vulnerabilities may result in legal repercussions, including lawsuits or revocation of certifications by medical device regulators. The hard-coded value, even if the risk is deemed low, could expose the company to liability if future exploitation occurs. The cross-jurisdictional nature of medical devices amplifies the need for compliance across various legal standards, further complicating the legal landscape for Corazón (Wizemann, 2010). The company's proactive approach reflects the broader industry trend of recognising cyber security as a critical component of medical device safety (Williams & Woodward, 2015).
            </p>
            <p>
              Although Corazón's charitable efforts, while admirable, raise potential social issues. If a vulnerability were exploited, it could disproportionately affect individuals with lower incomes who benefit from free or discounted devices. This would create a paradoxical situation in which the most vulnerable populations are most at risk due to Corazón's well-intentioned outreach. The company has an ethical responsibility to ensure that its devices, even those provided at reduced costs, meet the same strict security standards as any other. 
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, Corazón's approach to its heart monitoring device aligns well with the ethical standards set by both the ACM and BCS Codes of Conduct. However, the identified vulnerability in the device's wireless connectivity highlights the ongoing ethical obligation to safeguard users, especially when the product involves critical medical technology. While the immediate risk may be low, the potential for future harm emphasises the need for continuous improvement and a proactive stance on security. Balancing innovation with public safety and accountability is essential for maintaining ethical integrity in both computing and medical technology fields.
